How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   Using the Windows FC (File Compare) command prompt.
   I typed FC old_game.js new_game.js
   
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help me compare between the old versions and new versions, to see the diffrences in each.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It gives you the flexibility on when to create a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think Git is mostly for programming purpose while others like Google Docs are not for programming purposes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use the git log to see outputs and then git diff to compare two commits and see the changes. pressing q in both cases exit the log and diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    A typo could lead to that.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git for a small code that i will write.
